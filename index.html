		<h3>The Wha-?</h3>
			<p class="blue">The Borderlands are dangerous places, filled to the brim with bandits and wildlife that are sure to hunt you down and eat you alive - Yes, the bandits will do that to people -. Why come to such barren wastelands when nothing but death fills the air?</p>
			<button>Find Out More</button>
			<p class="blue">Well for some, such things are just occupational hazards that stand in the way between them and glory. Glory of what you ask? Well, legends have it that the greatest treasure in the universe lies within hidden chambers that we call Vaults.</p>
			<button>Find Out More</button>
			<p class="blue">Well let me tell you, that the legends are true. Pandora is a planet of mysteries... Or was at least, we're pretty much done with it. Well anyway, what once was a mining planet turned into a hub for hunters of Vaults to venture on. The first Vault was filled with an unexpected surprise but news gets 'round fast and that lead to the second vault to being found by the Hyperion Corporation.</p>
			<button>Find Out More</button>
			<p class="blue">I heard rumors that Atlas had found another one with a high tech Vault finding robot but I also heard that it was just four bandits that had wandered into trouble with an old droid. But not even I can confirm any of these rumors, there's no evidence of a Vault even being opened, they probably just psychos telling tales to get their hands on my guns, and they got my guns alright.</p>
			<button>Find Out More</button>
			<p class="blue">And now? We're off to Promethea, there's a cult of crazy kids or something running around and the Crimson Raiders want to sort them out or something. Not that I care, that just means I have a new audience to sell to, heh. </p>
			<button>Find Out More</button>
			<p class="blue">Well young mercenary, I cannot wait to sell you my wares, hope you're patient enough to wait for us, don't kill anything without us!</p>
